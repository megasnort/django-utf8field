Miranda Mouse
The sun was shining down outside, and the mice were all very warm and comfortable.
A bee came buzzing in under the roof.
The bee buzzed in Miranda's ear.
Miranda woke up.
The bee flew off, into the sunshine.

Miranda woke up.
Miranda looked down at the stones below.
She could see the sunlight, shining on the stones.
There was no one in the building.
Miranda blew in her brother 's ear.
Jeremy Mouse opened one eye.
“I'm going out,” she said.
“Come with me, Jeremy.”
But Jeremy was much too sleepy to get up.
He shut his eye, and went back to sleep.
“I'm going out,” said Miranda.
